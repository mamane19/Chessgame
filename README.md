## Getting Started
The program is structured using the [module architecture](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_modules.htm#:~:text=A%20module%20allows%20you%20to,file%20consisting%20of%20Python%20code) to make the code readabiliy very easy.

### Third party libraries:
- [tkinter](https://pypi.org/project/tkintertable/)
- [Deja Vu (font)](https://www.1001fonts.com/dejavu-sans-font.html)

We recommend you to use a virtual environment to install those packages for you to not get your computer overwhelmed in terms of space. you can visit this [website](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) if you would like to do so. NOte that it would not be a problem to run the program if you did not use a virtual environment.



To execute the program, run the entry-point file using the command:

```
python main.py
```
If you have multiple versions of python in your system, use the command bellow:
```
python3 main.py
```

If your system does not read the UNICODES, you can set the UNICODE global variable to False and run it with the standard characters.
## Test
We have used unittest to test the program; unittest is a unit testing python framework; it helps to write readable and scalable testing scripts for python programs. <br/>
To test this program, run the command
```
unittest
```
inside the project's root directory with your terminal/command prompt
